## **Virtual Office Network with VPN using Cisco Packet Tracer**  

### **Project Overview**  
This project simulates a **Virtual Office Network** using **VPN technology** in **Cisco Packet Tracer** to enable secure remote access. It includes **DNS, SMTP, FTP, DHCP, RIP v2, SSH, and Telnet** for efficient communication. The network is designed with **subnetting, VLANs, and encrypted VPN tunnels**, ensuring security and performance.  

---

### **Features**  
✔ **VPN Integration** – Secure communication between remote users and office network.  
✔ **Dynamic IP Allocation** – DHCP for automatic IP assignment and subnet optimization.  
✔ **Routing with RIP v2** – Ensures smooth packet transfer across the network.  
✔ **DNS & SMTP Setup** – Enables website hosting and email services.  
✔ **FTP Server** – Secure file transfers within the network.  
✔ **SSH & Telnet** – Remote administration for IT management.

### **Network Design**  
The network consists of:  
- **Routers & Switches** configured with VLANs.  
- **Subnetting** for optimized IP address allocation.  
- **VPN Tunnels** for encrypted remote connectivity.  
- **Security Measures** including authentication and encryption.
