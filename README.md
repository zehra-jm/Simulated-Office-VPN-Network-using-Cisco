## **Virtual Office Network with VPN using Cisco Packet Tracer**  

### **Project Overview**  
This project simulates a **Virtual Office Network** using **VPN technology** in **Cisco Packet Tracer** to enable secure remote access. It includes **DNS, SMTP, FTP, DHCP, RIP v2, SSH, and Telnet** for efficient communication. The network is designed with **subnetting, VLANs, and encrypted VPN tunnels**, ensuring security and performance.

### **Features**  
âœ” **VPN Integration** â€“ Secure communication between remote users and office network.  
âœ” **Dynamic IP Allocation** â€“ DHCP for automatic IP assignment and subnet optimization.  
âœ” **Routing with RIP v2** â€“ Ensures smooth packet transfer across the network.  
âœ” **DNS & SMTP Setup** â€“ Enables website hosting and email services.  
âœ” **FTP Server** â€“ Secure file transfers within the network.  
âœ” **SSH & Telnet** â€“ Remote administration for IT management.

### **Network Design**  
The network consists of:  
- **Routers & Switches** configured with VLANs.  
- **Subnetting** for optimized IP address allocation.  
- **VPN Tunnels** for encrypted remote connectivity.  
- **Security Measures** including authentication and encryption.
